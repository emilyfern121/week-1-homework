Step 2: I added alt text for all of the images in the HTML file.

Step 3: I made sure the links in the nav bar were working properly. 

Step 4: I added notes for each section of the page so the next person can understand the layout of the page.

Step 6: I organized the CSS selectors and properties to follow the semantic structure.

Step 7: I added notes to the CSS file so the next person can understand what section of the HTML the styles apply to.
